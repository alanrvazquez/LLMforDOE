A 32‑run two‑level design is based on a 32×32 Hadamard matrix (31 usable orthogonal columns). Constructing it requires explicitly generating and verifying 31 orthogonal columns, selecting 25 that collectively maximize resolution and minimize aberration, and then outputting all 32×25 entries. Doing this correctly requires algorithmic construction or software (such as SAS, JMP, Minitab, R packages FrF2/Mixexp), not manual generation.
